# Project_Concepts_of_DataScience

The goal of this project is to implement a Ternary Search Tree (TST) in Python, with operations for insertion, searching, and retrieving all strings. We will also analyze the time complexity of these operations and benchmark the implementation to verify its performance characteristics. In the end, this project should be able to provide an understanding of TSTs and their performance characteristics, as well as a working implementation of a TST in Python.
